#### Documentation
##### Periodically checks the configured directory
	I implemented the design Command pattern for structuring a behaviour 
	that periodically checks the configured directory. The Task 
	interface declares a command that lets the ScheduleTaskService
	class set the request and call the method (scheduleTask), this 
	operation lets the Timer run methods that periodically checks directory
	in the DirectoryRepeatableCheck class.
